                    Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, the first film in the epic eight-part Harry Potter series, is reaching its 20th anniversary this year. To celebrate, we're looking at 20 of its most iconic scenes that we still think about today. Join us over the next couple of months as more moments begin to magically appear every Wizarding Wednesday and see if any of your favourites pop up!
                    Expect quizzes, videos, fan content, deep-dives, puzzles and much more. Grab your Hogwarts trunk, we've got a lot to unpack!

                    So here we are. After many weeks of exciting wizarding world activities, such as meeting dragons, discovering Invisibility Cloaks, playing Quidditch and making new friends - we find ourselves at the end of our 20 key moments from Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone. And what could be a more fitting way to end things than the Hogwarts end-of-term feast? Pull up a chair, grab a plate and join us for our final celebration. It's time to rewatch the first film all over again and immerse yourself in the magical journey that started 20 years ago.
